# Welcome to Virtual Reality for the Web

This repository has the source, graphics, and models for examples from the book "Virtual Reality for the Web" by Packt publishing. This book is currently being edited. I have created this repository to store the files used in examples and exercises, and to allow technical editors and my self may any corretions to the files.

# Notes on source files

In most cases, these files are sucessive changes to 'index.vr.js' However, I will present them as' index_cool_feature.vr.js' in the source here. When you obtain these files (through a .zip download or clone), please rename the file to index.vr.js.

I thought about making a whole new branch (confusing to some), a whole new director (can take minutes to create all of the React/ReactVR supporting files), and decided the rename was the easiest way to do it. I'm open to suggestions on better ways!

# Countdown to using the files

Either:
 2. Read my book

OR:

 4. Download Node.js
 3. Use npm to install ReactVR
 2. Initialize a new directory
 
Then: (either case)

 1. Replace the index.vr.js files with the appropriate index_cool_feature.vr.js and client.js (located in the VR folder)
 0. Put any model files, etc. in the static_assets folder.
 
 Note that for a large website, you may want to split up the static_assets folder and reorganize your source; these examples have been left artificially simple so as not to clutter up the examples.
 
 Also please note, you really should leave more comments. I've added more comments in the comitted files than are in the book; this was to avoid blowing up the page count.
